By understanding these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be equipped to approach the problem methodically. Youâ€™ll need to iterate over the grid, apply logical operations to identify the perimeter of the island, and account for the specific conditions described in the task. This project not only tests your algorithmic thinking but also reinforces your ability to manipulate data structures and apply logical reasoning to solve problems.
