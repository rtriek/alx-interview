# Rotate 2D Matrix
## Resources
- Python Official Documentation:

  - [Data Structures (list comprehensions, nested list comprehension)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
  - [More on Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)
- GeeksforGeeks Articles:

  - [Inplace rotate square matrix by 90 degrees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inplace-rotate-square-matrix-by-90-degrees/)
  - [Transpose a matrix in Single line in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transpose-matrix-single-line-python/)
- TutorialsPoint:

  - [Python Lists](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm) for basics of list manipulation in Python.

By understanding these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be able to approach the problem methodically, first transposing the matrix and then reversing each row to achieve a 90-degree clockwise rotation. This project not only tests your ability to manipulate 2D matrices but also challenges you to think about optimizing your solution to operate in-place, thus improving their problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills in Python.
